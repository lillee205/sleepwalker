Site used in Math for America, LA program for teachers to demonstrate how coding can visualize mathematical problems

## About
Simulates the following math problem:
Suppose you have a sleepwalker who's standing in the middle of a road that is r*2 steps long, where r = radius. How long does it take for the sleepwalker to reach either end of the path?

Through repeated experiments, you will find that it takes the sleepwalker about r^2 steps to get to the end of the path.
